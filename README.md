# 🛍️ E-Commerce Sales & Call Center Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze data related to an e-commerce call center and sales performance, in order to support decision-making, improve customer interactions, and boost sales efficiency.

## 📌 Project Objective

Analyze operational data from a sales call center to:
- Improve call center performance
- Identify sales opportunities
- Provide actionable recommendations to business owners

## 🧮 Tools Used
- Power BI for interactive dashboards
- Excel (Pivot Tables) for initial data exploration
- SQL for data filtering (optional if needed)

## 📊 Key Analytical Questions

### For Business Decision Making:
- What are the top-selling products by city?
- Who are the top-performing sales representatives?
- Which stores have the highest approval rates?
- What is the average price of approved products?
- Is there a relationship between response time and deal approval?
- Which products get rejected frequently?
- What are the peak days/times for approvals?

### For Call Center Agents:
- What is the average number of calls before approval?
- Which customers were contacted multiple times with no success?
- Which cities have the highest rejection rates and why?
- What are the common rejection reasons?
- Is there a link between store manager and order success?
- Are there visual or product patterns for approvals?

### General Performance Metrics:
- Overall approval rate
- Performance comparison between cities
- Does product name/type affect client decision?

## 📈 Example Insight

If customers from **Cairo** tend to approve more orders when response time is within **5 minutes**, then:
- Prioritize quick response in Cairo
- Automate replies for faster engagement

## ✅ Recommendations

Based on the above questions and structure, we recommend the following:
- Create a Power BI Dashboard answering these key questions
- Focus on response time as a key performance metric
- Identify top-performing products and agents per region
- Track rejection reasons and train the call center team accordingly
- Monitor customer interactions with more than 3 attempts for follow-up

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensure response time is in correct format, unify status labels, and handle missing data.
2. **Dashboard Design**: Visualize key KPIs such as approvals, top products, cities, and agents.
3. **Insight Documentation**: Provide a business report in PDF summarizing findings and recommendations.
